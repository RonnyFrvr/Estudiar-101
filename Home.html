        Welcome to the main page. Here i will teach you how to study.
        Studying is an act in which some people fail to do. Personally, for me, studying is easy. But who am I to talk, after all, I am the teacher and you're the student.

    <h2><u>Clearing The Mind</u></h2>
    <p>
        To properly study one must master the arts of <b>Clearing thy MInd</b>. To do this i usually listen to calm music. Eg:
        <iframe id=Iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g64BkZjSNBM?si=pInaFI1-zvUvQtIC" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>This video is by <b>Chill Cartoon Vibes</b>. I always watch these at 53% volume to aur our my mind and avoid distractions since I have <b>ADHD</b>.</p>
    </p>

    <p>
        More methods to clear your mind is through meditation, or <b>noise</b>. Yes, <b>noise</b> but not the noise you think. I'm talking stuff like:
        <dl>
            <li id="brown">
                Brown Noise-
            </li>
            <ld>
                Most recommended. Brown noise involves calm noises.
            </ld>
            <li id="white">
                White Noise-
            </li>
            <ld>
                Drowns out noises but is a but harsh
            </ld>
            <li id="pink">
                Pink Noise-
            </li>
            <ld>
                Calming, but not as calm as brown noise.
            </ld>
            <li id="green">Green Noise-

            </li>
            <ld>Mirrors noises from nature. Best for sleep</ld>
            <li id="blue">
                Blue Noise-
            </li>
            <ld>Much higher Frequency.</ld>
        </dl>
    </p>

    <h2><u>Summarizing</u></h2>
    <p>
        Summarizing refers to simplifying all of your notes to make it shorter. Doing this you must highlight or keep the most important information as well as an explanation of the concept in <b>your own words</b> so you can further prove your understanding.
        I usually do this before exams, around 1 weeks before, but if you know you cannot write fast or study well enough start way before the exams if not whenever you come home everyday, summarize the info learnt that day.
    </p>

    <h2><u>Repeat & Absorb</u></h2>
    <p>
        This method involves you repeating the words you summarized in your head over and over again. Don't just repeat it, absorb it. By this I mean actually get to know the content by memorizing it. If this is too hard you can do the following:
        <dl>
            <li>
                Flash cards-
            </li>
            <ld>
                Write down some notes on small cards and shuffle them up then question yourself and answer
            </ld>
            <li>
                Imitate being a teacher
            </li>
            <ld>
                Imitate being a teacher by teaching someone what you learnt or teaching yourself by standing infont of the mirror and teaching yourself.
            </ld>
        </dl>
        There are many other ways one can absorb knowledge.
    </p>
    <h2><u>Quiz</u></h2>
    <p>
        This is the final part. The part in which you prepare to face the exams. You can prepare by revising or by asking someone to quiz you. Ensure they shuffle the questions so that it becomes harder on you and you learn from your mistakes.
